/**Research the Math object in Javascript and tell me three of the methods you find and their use.
 *Here are three important methods from the Math object
 * Math.abs(x)' - returns the absolute value of number, which is the value of the number without regard to its sign.. It takes one argument, x, which can be any number.
 * Math.random(): This method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that is greater than or equal to  0 but less than 1, with approximately uniform distribution.
 * Math.PI': This property represents the value of the mathematical constant pi, which is approximately equal to 3.1. It is often used in mathematics when dealing with circles or trigonometry.

/**Research the Array Methods in Javascript and tell me three of the methods you find and their use.
 *These are three important array methods I found:
 * pop( ) - removes last item from array and returns it 
 * push(item) - Adds one or many items to the end of the array and returns the new length of the array
 * shift() - Removes first item from array and returns it

/** Research the String Methods in Javascript and tell me three of the methods you find and their use.
 *Here are the important string methods that I found.
 * toUpperCase() Method: This method is used to convert all the characters in a string to uppercase letters. It does not modify the original string but returns a new string with all characters converted to uppercase.
 * substring() Method: The substring() method is used to extract a portion of a string and return it as a new       string. It takes two parameters: the starting index (inclusive) and the ending index (exclusive) of the substring.
 * indexOf() Method: The indexOf() method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified value within a string. If the value is not found, it returns -1.
